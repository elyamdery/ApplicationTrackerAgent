# Learning Automation Testing with Oggy

Welcome to your personalized automation testing learning journey with Oggy! This README contains our structured learning plan to help you master UI and API testing for the Application Tracker project.

## üëã Introduction

Hey there! I'm Oggy, your automation testing mentor. Together, we'll explore the world of test automation using Selenium for UI testing and Postman for API testing. We'll also learn how to record test executions to make debugging easier.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Master the fundamentals of test automation
- Write and execute Selenium UI tests with confidence
- Create and run Postman API tests like a pro
- Use screen recording to visualize and debug test execution
- Develop skills in test organization and reporting

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7+ installed
2. Postman desktop application installed
3. Chrome browser installed
4. Application Tracker running on localhost:8080

#### 3.1 GET Endpoints

- [ ] Implement tests for "Get All Applications" request
  - Verify status code is 200
  - Check that response is JSON
  - Verify response has applications property
  - Check that applications is an array
- [ ] Run the test and review the logs and saved response
- [ ] Implement tests for "Get Application by ID" request
  - Verify status code is 200
  - Check that response is JSON
  - Verify response has the correct application data
- [ ] Run the test and review the logs and saved response

#### 3.2 POST Endpoints

- [ ] Implement tests for "Create Application" request
  - Verify status code is 200
  - Check that response has success property
  - Verify response has id property for the new application
- [ ] Run the test and review the logs and saved response
- [ ] Create a test for error handling (e.g., missing required fields)
  - Submit an invalid request
  - Verify appropriate error response
  - Check error message content

#### 3.3 Advanced API Testing

- [ ] Create environment variables in Postman
- [ ] Set up a test data generation script
- [ ] Implement a test sequence that creates, retrieves, updates, and deletes an application

### Section 4: Advanced Topics (Weeks 6-7)

- [ ] Create a test data generator for applications
- [ ] Implement database cleanup after tests
- [ ] Use fixtures for common test data

#### 4.2 Test Reporting

- [ ] Generate HTML reports for Selenium tests
